# G'MIC Node Editor Generator üîÜ
A Python node code generator for the [G'MIC Node Editor](https://github.com/polygonvariable/gmic-node-editor) Blender addon.

# Why Use the Generator?
Writing code for nodes can be a repetitive and time-consuming task. To simplify the development process, this code generator automates the creation of node code, significantly reducing development time.

# How It Works
1. **Filter Command Array:**
The generator starts with an array of filter commands.

2. **Filter Library Lookup:**
Each command is matched with entries in the G'MIC filter library JSON file.

3. **Simplified JSON Creation:**
A simplified JSON file is prepared based on the matched filters, which organizes the data for easier use.

4. **Final Node Code Generation:**
The simplified JSON file is processed to generate the final node code, ready to be used with the addon.

# Modules
1. `app.js`: The main script that generate complete node code.
2. `construct.js`: Searches the G'MIC filter library JSON file to create a simplified JSON file for a given set of commands.
3. `generate.js`: Uses the simplified JSON file to generate the final node code.
4. `download.js`: Handles downloading the G'MIC filter library JSON file.
